            <h1>What is <b><i>Deep Learning</i></b>?</h1>
            <p>
                Deep learning is a branch of the development of machine learning, which uses a model inspired by the
                human brain — the interaction of neurons.
                <br>
                <br>
                The term itself appeared back in the 1980s, but until 2012, there was a lack of capacity for the
                implementation of this technology and almost no one paid attention to it. After a series of articles by
                well-known scientists and a number of other scientific publications, this technology quickly became
                popular and received the attention of major media, The New York Times was the first “big” media, who
                wrote about it. One of the reasons for the publication was a scientific work of a few specialists from
                the universities of Toronto: Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Satskever and Jeff Hinton. They described and
                analyzed the results of the ImageNet image recognition contest, where their neural network, trained with
                deep learning, won with a large margin — the system identified 85% of the objects on the pictures.

    <section id="how" class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-center">
            <h1>How does <b><i>Deep Learning</i></b> work?</h1>
            <p>
                This technology imitates the process of abstract thinking and it knows how to generalize. For
                example, a computer-trained neural network does not recognize handwritten letters well so if you want
                the AI not to be messed when analyzing handwritten letters you should upload a dataset with every
                handwritten letter in it. Only in this case, it will be more or less accurate.
                <br>
                <br>
                Deep training is often used when working with multilayer artificial neural networks and in such
                case, the neural network will be able to cope with the task, mentioned previously.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here is a simple example — we upload a photograph of a boy and a girl into a special neural network. On
                the first layer, neurons respond to simple visual triggers like brightness differences. On the second -
                to more complex ones like corners and circles. When analyzing the third layer, neurons are able to react
                to inscriptions and human faces. For each next layer the defined triggers will be more complex. The
                neural network itself determines which visual elements are needed to solve the task, and ranks them in
                order of importance to further understand what is depicted in the photo.

            <h1>What applications for <b><i>Deep Learning</i></b> are there?</h1>
            <p>
                The majority of projects using deep learning is used in the identification of photos or audio and
                diagnosis of diseases. For example, it is used in Google app, which uses the phone camera to translate
                the text in real time: the Deep Learning technology allows you to determine if there are any letters in
                the picture and then translates them. Another project that works with photos is a face recognition
                system called DeepFace. It is able to recognize human faces with 97.25% accuracy, which is almost the
                same accuracy as a real human has.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2016, Google released WaveNet, a system that can simulate human speech. To do this, the company
                uploaded millions of minutes of recorded voice requests to the system, which had been used in the OK
                Google project, and after having been studied, the neural network itself was able to formulate sentences
                with the correct stresses, accent and without illogical pauses.
                <br>
                <br>
                Deep learning can semantically segment an image or a video — it is capable of not only to see that there
                is an object in the picture, but it can also ideally outline its frame. This technology is used in
                self-driving vehicles to understand if there are obstacles or road marking on the road. It also can read
                information from traffic signs to avoid accidents. Neural networks are used in medicine, for example, to
                determine diabetic retinopathy using photos of patients’ eyes.
